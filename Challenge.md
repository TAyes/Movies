     * [List of trending movies](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover).
     * [Details of a movie](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-details).
    
## Note:

* You can use the following api key to authenticate your requests : c***********************3b8f3
* Follow this [documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/images) to get the full poster image path of a movie.

## Remarks:

* Even if itâ€™s a simple project, Implement the app in the best way that represents your understanding of high quality
software. It will be your best way to share your knowledge with us.
* The application code should be pushed to a public github repository, and share the repository link with us.
* The application will be compiled and run under the latest iOS SDK with the latest production Xcode.
* The application is expected to be written in Swift.
